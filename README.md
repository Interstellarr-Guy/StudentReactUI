Secure Student Management System

This project demonstrates real-world backend security using JWT, Spring Security filters, and role-based authorization. The frontend communicates securely with the backend using token-based authentication similar to production systems.
 FrontEnd (React - Netlify) --> HTTPS (JWT token) --> Backend  API (Spring Boot - Railway) --> MySql Database

 Technologies used :
 * Frontend :React + Axios 
 * Backend :Spring Boot + Spring Security
 * Authentication: JWT (Role based)
 * Database :MySQL
 * Deployment :Netlify + Railway
 * Security : Token Authentication + CORS + Role Authorization
